(a) Simplified diagram of modelled compartments, key parameters, and simplified incidence equation
for the instantaneous and proposed approaches to modelling sexual partnerships.
(b) Modelled heterosexual HIV incidence in Eswatini under the instantaneous versus proposed approach;
relative differences grow over time
as partnership-level herd effects accumulate in the proposed approach.
