For decades, models of sexually transmitted infections like HIV
have simulated sexual partnerships as effectively instantaneous, through the use of rate-based equations.

We developed a new approach to simulate sexual partnerships, which properly accounts for partnership duration.

We then show how existing models have likely overestimated the importance of prevention in long-term partnerships for epidemic control.
