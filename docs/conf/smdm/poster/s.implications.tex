\begin{itemize}
  \item Proposed model overcomes decades-old partnership modelling challenge\cite{2}
  \begin{itemize}[left=0pt]
    \item Captures \emph{true partnership duration} $\rightarrow$ early transmission and wasted contacts
    \item Captures accumulation of \emph{partnership-level herd effects}
    \item Avoids need for more complex modelling frameworks (e.g. network)
  \end{itemize}
  \item \emph{Existing models likely overestimate impacts of prevention in longer partnerships},\\
        and {underestimate impacts of prevention in shorter partnerships}
\end{itemize}
