\begin{itemize}
  \item Compartmental models of STI \& HIV are \emph{key tools} in epidemic response \cite{1}
  \item Modelled rate of new infections depends on \emph{average infection prevalence}
  \item So: \emph{newly infected immediately contribute to more infections} (incidence)
  \item Assumption: partnerships are effectively instantaneous \cite{2}
  \item Reality: partnerships include before \& after transmission
  \item This assumption can \emph{bias estimates of intervention impact} \cite{3}
