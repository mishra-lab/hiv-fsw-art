\dots larger HIV prevalence ratio among FSW versus other women
magnified the effects of lower cascade among any group (FSW, clients, or everybody else)
on cumulative additional infections. % Ugh need to rephrase...

\dots such differences could be even greater in the context of concentrated or mixed epidemics,
as compared to the highly generalized eSwatini HIV epidemic explored.

\dots prevalence among FSW may actually decline faster than among women overall,
due to short duration in sex work; thus the prevalence ratio among FSW versus women overall may decline.

\dots

Multiple factors contributed to differential acquisition and transmission risk among men vs women:
