\section{Experiments}\label{foi.exp}
In this section, we describe several experiments (methods and results) to
highlight differences among the various approaches
to modelling HIV transmission via sexual partnerships.
Specifically:
\sref{foi.exp.xph}~and~\ref{foi.exp.dur} examine how
the calculated per-partnership probability of transmission $B$ differs under assumptions of:
within- \vs between-partnership heterogeneity in the per-act probability of transmission $\beta$,
and 1-year \vs complete partnership durations $\delta$; then
\sref{foi.exp.model} explores differences in key transmission model outputs
among the force of infection equations from \sref{foi.prior}~and~\ref{foi.prop}.
In many transmission models,
a justification for chosing each specific approach is rarely given.
Thus, this section aims to illustrate potential implications of these choices.
%===================================================================================================
\subsection{Within- \vs Between-Partnership Heterogeneity}\label{foi.exp.xph}
For computing an average per-partnership probability of transmission $B$,
\sref{foi.prior.xph} clarified the interpretations of
\eqref{eq:B.wph} \vs \eqref{eq:B.bph} as modelling
within-partnership heterogeneity (WPH) \vs between-partnership heterogeneity (BPH), respectively.
As shown in \sref{sr.foi.proof}, $B_{\wph} \ge B_{\bph}$.
Here we explore under what conditions the ratio $B_{\wph}~/~B_{\bph}$ is maximized
--- \ie when does the choice of approach matter most.
For simplicity, we considered a single illustrative factor
affecting $\alpha \in [0,1]$ proportion of sex acts ($1-\alpha$ are unaffected),
with relative probability of transmission $R \in [0.01,10]$.
We then computed $B_{\wph}$ and $B_{\bph}$ for $A \in [1,1000]$ total sex acts,
using a base per-act probability of transmission $\beta = 0.34$\%
as a representative value for HIV \cite{Boily2009}.

    $R$: relative $\beta$ given factor (log scale);
    gray lines denote equivalent contours for $2\beta$~and~$\frac12\beta$.}
\end{figure}
Figure~\ref{fig:B.xph.surf} illustrates four 2-dimensional cross sections of $B(R,\alpha,A)$
under WPH \vs BPH, and the ratio $B_{\wph} / B_{\bph}$;
the cross sections were at: $A = 32$, $\alpha = 0.5$, $R = 0.1$, and $R = 5$.
Based on these results, the difference between approaches can be summarized as:
\begin{itemize}
  \item negligible for $A < 10$, and small for $A < 100$
  \item increasing as $R$ gets farther from 1 ($R \rightarrow 0$ or $R \rightarrow \infty$)
  \item maximized by specific values of $(\alpha,A)$ for a given $R$, including
    $\alpha > \frac12$ for $R < 1$, and $\alpha < \frac12$ for $R > 1$
\end{itemize}
The specific values of $(\alpha,A)$ which maximize
the difference between approaches for a given $R$ and $\beta$
create a continuous curve (Figure~\ref{fig:B.xph.max}), which slowly tends towards
$\alpha \rightarrow 1, A \rightarrow \infty$ as $R \rightarrow 0$, and
$\alpha \rightarrow 0, A \rightarrow 0$ as $R \rightarrow \infty$.
The curve is sigmoidal for log-transformed $A$,
and shifts left with increasing $\beta$.
We did not derive an analytical expression, but it should be possible to do so.
In the context of HIV, the difference between approaches would be
larger for protective factors (\eg condoms)
affecting most of a large number of sex acts ($\alpha > 1000$);
and likewise larger for risk-increasing factors (\eg anal sex)
affecting a minority of a moderate number of sex acts ($\alpha \approx 100$).
%===================================================================================================
\subsection{Partnership Durations}\label{foi.exp.dur}
As described in \sref{foi.prior.ptr}, multiple prior models have
implicitly assumed a maximum partnership duration $\delta \le 1$ year.
As such, the adjustment for inert sex acts \eqref{eq:B} would have reduced effect.
This reduction can be quantified via
the effective probability of transmission per sex act $\beta'$
--- \ie tangent slopes in Figure~\ref{fig:binom.dur} --- defined as:
\begin{equation}\label{eq:beta.eff}
  \beta' = \frac{B}{A} = \frac{1 - {(1 - \beta)}^{A}}{A}
\end{equation}
Figure~\ref{fig:dur.surf} illustrates
the 1-year $\beta'_1$ \vs true-duration $\beta'_\delta$, for different
partnership durations $\delta \in [1, 30]$ year and
sex frequencies $F \in [1,180]$ per year.
Assuming $\delta \le 1$ can considerably increase the modelled rate of transmission
for partnerships with $F \ge 52$ (\ie weekly) and a true duration $\delta \ge 5$ years,
including up to \emph{8-fold} difference with
$F \approx 100$ per year and $\delta \approx 30$ years.
Thus, prior models using $\delta \le 1$ may have
substantially overestimated the relative contribution of
longer partnerships with frequent sex --- including main/spousal partnerships ---
to overall transmission.

    $F$: frequency of sex per partnership (per year, log scale);
    $\delta$: partnership duration (years, linear scale);
    $\beta_1, \beta_\delta$: effective probability of transmission per sex act,
      for 1 year \vs total partnership duration, respectively.}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Comparing Approaches in a Transmission Model}\label{foi.exp.model}
Next, we sought to explore how different approaches to
modelling and parameterizing the force of infection equation
influence key outputs from a full transmission model.
We focused on two aspects of prior approaches:
whether or not partnership durations are effectively capped at 1 year (\sref{foi.prior.dur}), and
whether incidence is aggregated across partnerships as a rate \vs proportion (\sref{foi.prior.ptr}).
Thus, we considered 3 prior approaches:
\emph{Instantaneous Rate-Duration}~(\ird),
\emph{Instantaneous Rate-1-Year}~(\iry), and
\emph{Instantaneous Proportion-1-Year}~(\ipy),
plus the \emph{Effective Partnerships Adjustment} (\epa) approach from \sref{foi.prop}
(Table~\ref{tab:foi.models}).
Among these 4 approaches, we sought to characterize:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item \label{obj:foi.dyn}
  fundamental differences in transmission dynamics under each approach
  \item \label{obj:foi.tpaf}
  differences in model-estimated prevention priorities under each approach
  \end{enumerate}
For aim~\ref{obj:foi.dyn}, we compared group-specific HIV incidence
using \emph{equal} model parameters across approaches.
While the specific parameters required by each approach are slightly different,
we derived these parameters from a consistent set of ``upstream'' data as described below.
For aim~\ref{obj:foi.tpaf}, we compared selected
transmission population attributable fractions (TPAFs, details below)
using \emph{approach-specific} (\ie recalibrated) model parameters.
Since applied models are usually calibrated to a given context,
aim~\ref{obj:foi.tpaf} thus provides a realistic comparison of
how prevention priorities could differ when informed by distinct models using each approach.
\begin{table}
  \centering
  \caption{Compared approaches to modelling HIV transmission via sexual partnerships}

  \input{tab.models}
\end{table}
%---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\paragraph{Eswatini HIV Transmission Model}
We integrated each approach within an existing compartmental model
of heterosexual HIV transmission in Eswatini \cite{Knight2024art}
(full details in Appendix~\ref{mod}).
Briefly, the model includes: 2~sexes, 4~levels of sexual activity
--- including female sex workers (FSW) and their clients ---
and 4 partnership types (Figure~\ref{fig:model.risk}): % MAN below
main/spousal (14--19 years, lowest condom use),
casual (3--18 months, moderate condom use),
occasional/one-off sex work (1 sex act, highest condom use), and
regular/repeat sex work (2--12 months, high condom use).
The model also includes
5 stages of HIV infection (Figure~\ref{fig:model.hiv}) and
5 stages of the HIV treatment cascade (Figure~\ref{fig:model.cascade}), plus
anal \vs vaginal sex, male circumcision, and genital ulcer disease,
with differences over time and/or risk groups.
%---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\paragraph{Equal \& Approach-Specific Parameters}
\begin{figure}
  \centering\includegraphics[scale=1]{diag.foi.par}
  \caption{Flow chart for deriving model parameters for each force of infection approach
    from a consistent set of upstream parameters}
  \label{fig:diag.foi.par}
  \floatfoot{\fffoi. See \cite{Knight2023bias} for $K$ equation.}
\end{figure}
We calibrated the model (74 uncertain parameters) separately under each approach
using an adapted version of Incremental Mixture Importance Sampling (IMIS) \cite{Raftery2010}
(full details in \sref{mod.cal})
yielding 1000 model fits (parameter sets) per approach.
For all approaches, we directly specified or sampled the following ``upstream parameters'':
numbers of reported partners $x$ for a given recall period $\omega$ (see \sref{mod.par.pnum}),
partnership durations $\delta$ (see \sref{mod.par.pdur}), and
sex frequencies per partnership $F$ (see \sref{mod.par.fsex}).
Then, we derived the required ``downstream parameters'' for each approach
--- \ie $K$, $F$, and $\delta$ for \epa; $Q$ and $A$ for \ird, \iry, and \ipy ---
as shown in Figure~\ref{fig:diag.foi.par}.
For aim~\ref{obj:foi.dyn} we used \emph{equal} upstream parameters from \epa model fits,
while for aim~\ref{obj:foi.dyn} we used \emph{approach-specific} parameters.
\par
Appendix~\ref{sr.cal} provides detailed results of model calibration under the \epa approach.
Appendix~\ref{sr.foi.cal} provides selected results of model calibration under all 4 approaches,
including Figures~\ref{fig:fit.prev.foi}--\ref{fig:fit.inc1v2.foi} which illustrate
model-estimated HIV prevalence, incidence, and ratios thereof
\vs calibration targets under each approach.
Model fits under each approach were qualitatively similar,
though overall log-likelihoods were highest under \ipy and lowest under \iry
(Figure~\ref{fig:ll.hist.foi}).
Most posterior parameter distributions also differed significantly among approaches
(rank score test \cite{Kruskal1952}, Figure~\ref{fig:post.distr.foi}).
% TODO: (*) try to summarize patterns / trends in differences?
%---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\paragraph{Transmission-Driven Seroconcordance}
Figure~\ref{fig:fit.tdsc.foi} further illustrates the modelled
transmission-driven seroconcordance (TDSC) proportion for each partnership type
among infected individuals --- \ie using denominator (b) from \sref{foi.prop.tdsc}.
This model output is only possible under the \epa approach, and reflects
the relative reduction in onward transmission risk among infected individuals
due to infections ``trapped'' within partnerships.
The TDSC proportion increases rapidly for all partnership types during epidemic growth,
but later declines alongside HIV incidence.
% TODO: (?) % TDSC is related to: incidence (convolve) ptr duration distribution
The TDSC proportion tends to be higher for
longer partnerships (\eg main/spousal \vs other types) and for
partnership types with lower concurrency (\eg casual \vs sex work).
Since the TDSC proportion varies across time, partnership types, and risk groups,
it may be challenging to define a simplified incidence adjustment
to account for trapped infections in existing transmission models.

\end{figure}
%---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\subsubsection{Transmission Dynamics using Equal Parameters}\label{foi.exp.mod.dyn}
Figure~\ref{fig:foi.ep.incidence} illustrates HIV incidence under each approach among
FSW, clients, and everybody else (``lower risk'').
Specifically, Figure~\ref{fig:foi.ep.incidence.raw} illustrates incidence per person-year
(\epa repeated for comparison)
and Figure~\ref{fig:foi.ep.incidence.rel} illustrates relative differences \vs the \epa approach.%
\footnote{Relative differences were ``paired'' according to each parameter set $k$,
  and computed as $(\textsc{ixx}_k - \epa_k) / \epa_k$.}
We made the following observations:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Incidence among lower risk groups was generally much higher under 1-year approaches (\iry,~\ipy)
    --- underestimation of PTC under these approaches
    disproportionately increases transmission via main/spousal partnerships,
    allowing more transmission to/from lower risk individuals,
    including a positive feedback loop via increasing HIV prevalence
    given like-with-like mixing (see \sref{mod.par.mix.odds}).
  \item Incidence differences between the 1-year approaches (\iry,~\ipy) \vs \epa generally grew over time
    --- \epa explicitly models the accumulation of
    transmission-driven seroconcordant partnerships (Figure~\ref{fig:fit.tdsc}) wherein all sex acts are PTC;
    thus, by underestimating PTC throughout the epidemic,
    the 1-year approaches are initially less biased \vs \epa, but later overestimate incidence.
  \item Incidence among FSW and clients was lower under the ``incidence proportion'' approach (\ipy)
    --- incidence proportion \eqref{eq:foi.ip} treats all transmission risks as competing,
    and notably forces incidence $\lambda^\ip \le 1$,
    disproportionately reducing incidence among those at highest risk.
  \item Incidence under the full-duration approach (\ird) was consistently similar to \epa
    --- complete accounting of PTC under this approach delays
    effectively delays transmission in longer partnership types,
    but shorter partnerships contribute the majority of new infections.

\end{figure}
\par
Figure~\ref{fig:foi.wiw.ptr} further illustrates the proportions of modelled yearly HIV infections
transmitted via different partnership types under each approach
using equal parameters (top) and approach-specific parameters for comparison (bottom).
For equal parameters, the 1-year approaches (\iry,~\ipy) featured
the greatest proportions of transmission via main/spousal partnerships, and the least via sex work.
By contrast, the full-duration approach (\ird) featured
the smallest proportions transmitted via main/spousal partnerships, and the most via sex work.
The distribution under the proposed approach (\epa) was in between these two extremes.
%---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\subsubsection{Prevention Priorities using Approach-Specific Parameters}\label{foi.exp.mod.tpaf}
Many models applied to assess HIV prevention priorities
explicitly model specific intervention scenarios, often with a cost dimension.
However, these context-specific intervention and cost details
require additional analyses and/or assumptions,
and only explore a subset of the modelled transmission pathways.
By contrast, the TPAF reflects an ``intervention agnostic'' measure of
how any given transmission pathway contributes to transmission overall.
TPAFs are an extension of classic PAFs which additionally capture
the downstream infections averted by preventing upstream infections \cite{Mishra2014tpaf}.
The TPAF among population $j$ of transmission pathway $k$ is defined as
the relative difference in cumulative infections $\Omega$ among $j$ since a given time $t_0$
with \vs without transmission via $k$:
\begin{equation}\label{eq:tpaf}
  \textup{TPAF}_{jk}(t) = \frac{\Omega_{j}(t) - \Omega_{jk} (t)}{\Omega_{j}(t)}
  ,\qquad
  \Omega_{jk}(t) = \int_{t_0}^{t} \Lambda_{j,M_k=0}(\tau)\,d\tau
  ,\qquad
  t = t_0 + \Delta_t
\end{equation}
Thus, TPAFs reflect hypothetical interventions with perfect prevention,
ignoring practical implementation challenges associated with any real intervention.
Like classic PAFs, TPAFs can sum to more than 100\% \cite{Rowe2004,Mishra2021}.
\par
We computed TPAFs for the following transmission pathways:
main/spousal, casual, and sex work (occasional and regular combined) partnership types; and
transmission from FSW, clients, and everybody else (``lower risk'').
We computed these TPAFs under each of the 4 force of infection approaches,
over $\Delta_t = {}$1, 3, and 10-year time horizons,
starting in $t_0 = {}$1990, 2000, and 2010 (270 total TPAFs).
We implemented scenarios without transmission via pathway $k$
using a boolean ``mask'' applied to the mixing matrix $M_{pii'}$,
\emph{after} resolving the values per \sref{mod.par.mix},
such that mixing patterns were not affected.
%---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\paragraph{TPAFs of Partnership Types}
% TODO: (!) update text after improved calibration
Figure~\ref{fig:foi.tpaf.ptr} illustrates the TPAFs for partnership types.
TPAFs generally increased over longer time horizons $\Delta_t$,
increased with calendar year $t_0$ for non-sex work partnerships, and
decreased with $t_0$ for sex work (note vertical scales).
Such trends are consistent with prior work showing that
TPAFs of key populations are typically large at first
and decrease as epidemics become more widespread
\cite{Johnson2011,Mishra2012sr,Boily2015}.
\foreach \var/\lab in {%
  ptr/transmission via different partnership types,%
  popf/transmission from different risk groups}{
\begin{figure}
  \includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{foi.tpaf.\var}
  \caption{TPAF of \lab\ (horizontal facets),

    estimated under different force of infection approaches (colours)}
  \label{fig:foi.tpaf.\var}
  \floatfoot{\fffoi; \fftpaf; \ffbox.}
\end{figure}}
\par
TPAF differences across force of infection approaches were largest for main/spousal partnerships,
with 1-year approaches (\iry,~\ipy) significantly larger than the full-duration approach (\ird).
Main/spousal TPAFs under \epa were similar to \iry~and~\ipy from 1990 over short time horizons,
beyond which TPAFs under \epa were more similar to \ird;
similar to incidence differences in \sref{foi.exp.mod.dyn},
these findings reflect reduced transmission via longer partnerships over time
due to the accumulation of seroconcordant partnerships, which are only captured under \epa.
Relative differences in casual partnership TPAFs across approaches
were exactly opposite (but less pronounced) \vs differences in main/spousal partnership TPAFs.
As such, casual TPAFs were always greater than main/spousal TPAFs under \ird,
while main/spousal TPAFs were almost always greater than casual TPAFs under \iry~and~\ipy.
There were minimal differences in TPAFs for main/spousal or casual partnerships
\emph{between} 1-year approaches (\iry~\vs~\ipy).
\par
Interestingly, differences in sex work TPAFs across force of infection approaches
were less pronounced \vs for other partnership types.
These smaller differences could be explained by two factors.
First, HIV prevalence in Eswatini may saturate among FSW and their clients,
such that the rate of new infections is mainly influenced by
``supply'' of susceptible individuals via risk group turnover,
and less by differences between force of infection approaches.
Second, modelled regular sex work partnership durations were not especially long or short,
with posterior distribution spanning 0.5--2.0 years
(see \sref{mod.par.pdur} and Figure~\ref{fig:post.distr}).
By 2010, clearer differences across approaches in sex work TPAFs emerged,
which were similar to differences for casual partnerships.
%---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\paragraph{TPAFs of Risk Groups}
Figure~\ref{fig:foi.tpaf.popf} illustrates the TPAFs for transmission from selected risk groups,
which can be related to the goal of perfect viral suppression via ART.
In 1990, the TPAFs of FSW and clients were largest
and overall similar to TPAFs of sex work partnerships.
In 2000 and 2010, the TPAFs of FSW and clients remained similar to sex work partnerships,
but TPAFs for clients \vs FSW grew larger
and with more pronounced differences between force of infection approaches.
Such results reflect the greater onward transmission potential of clients \vs FSW
due to their larger population size and greater number of casual partnerships
(\eg Figure~\ref{fig:wiw.base.alluvial}).
TPAFs of lower risk groups (not engaged in sex work) had differences across approaches that were
similar to those for main/spousal partnerships but less pronounced.
These differences reflect the strong influence of the 1-year partners duration assumption
(\ie approaches \iry,~\ipy) on the contribution of lower risk groups to overall transmission.
