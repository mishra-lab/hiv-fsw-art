Many HIV transmission models define the rate of infections using %SM: add compartmental?
the average rate of sexual partner change times
the total probability of transmission per partnership
--- making sexual partnerships effectively instantaneous.
Current alternatives to this approach can be prohibitively complicated.
We propose a new approach where the rate of infections is defined using
the average number of current sexual partners times
the rate of transmission per partnership,
after removing partnerships where transmission has already occurred.
Experiments show that both approaches can produce similar model outputs
if partner change rates are input correctly. %SM: and or because the right data available?
However, a common practice of approximating partner change rates  
with numbers of partners reported in the past year
can cause the instantaneous approach to overestimate
transmission within long-term partnerships. %SM: consider adding somethign like....and which the proposed approach can help mitigate?.
