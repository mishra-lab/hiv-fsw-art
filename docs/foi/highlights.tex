\begin{itemize}
  \item We review assumptions and limitations of current models of the force of infection
  \item We develop a new force of infection model to accurately represent repeated contacts
  \item We apply current and proposed models to HIV transmission in Eswatini
  \item We illustrate key differences in inferred drivers of transmission under each model
\end{itemize}
