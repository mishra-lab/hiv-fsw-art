\section{Introduction}\label{intro}
The force of infection --- or incidence --- equation defines
the rate of new infections among a susceptible population.
As the core of most transmission models, this equation specifies
the assumed mechanistic relationships between incidence and factors of interest,
such as contact rates or the probability of transmission.
The assumptions underpinning a force of infection equation
are therefore key determinants of the modelled transmission dynamics,
and ultimately evidence generated by the model.
