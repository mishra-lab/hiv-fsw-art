\section{Results}\label{art.res}
We first summarize modelled patterns of HIV transmission in the base case (1000 model fits),
calibrated to reflect the Eswatini epidemic up to 2020.
Our model suggests that transmission within regular sex work partnerships
was a dominant driver of early epidemic growth
(Figures \ref{fig:wiw.base.part}~and~\ref{fig:wiw.base.alluvial}).
However, from approximately 1997 onward,
the majority of new yearly infections were transmitted within casual partnerships, % MAN
including 44\% (median) of infections in 2020 in the base case.% % MAN
\footnote{In our model, casual partnerships can be formed by any subpopulation,
  and these partnerships subsume transactional partnerships.}
By 2020, the majority of cumulative infections acquired
were among women with lowest sexual activity (Figure~\ref{fig:wiw.base.to}),
while the majority of cumulative infections transmitted
were from clients (Figure~\ref{fig:wiw.base.from}).
Overall HIV prevalence in 2020 was median (95\% CI):
24.4~(23.3,~25.4)\,\% (Figure~\ref{fig:fit.prev}), % MAN
and overall incidence was 8.0~(6.7,~9.4) per 1000 person-years (Figure~\ref{fig:fit.inc}).
The prevalence ratio between FSW and women overall was 1.75~(1.69,~1.86), % MAN
and between clients and men overall it was 2.14~(1.55,~2.99) % MAN
(Figure~\ref{fig:fit.prev1v2}).
Due to turnover and higher HIV incidence among FSW,
achieving similar rates of diagnosis among FSW \vs other women (Figure~\ref{fig:fit.dx.rate})
required approximately twice the rate of testing. % MAN
Sex work contributed a growing proportion of infections
over 2020--2040: from 40\% to 52\% (Figure~\ref{fig:wiw.base.part}). % MAN

\subsection{Objective~1: Influence of cascade differences between subpopulations}\label{art.res.1}
Figure~\ref{fig:art.1.cascade} illustrates ART cascade attainment over time
in each of the four counterfactual scenarios (\casmd overall by 2020),
and the base case (\cashi overall by 2020).
Figure~\ref{fig:art.1.inc} illustrates overall HIV incidence in each scenario.
Figure~\ref{fig:art.1.rai} then illustrates
cumulative additional infections (CAI) and additional incidence rate (AIR)
in each counterfactual scenario \vs the base case.
Leaving behind neither FSW and nor clients led to the fewest CAI: median (95\%~CI)
13.3~(9.2,~18.7)\,\% more than the base case by 2030. % MAN
By contrast, leaving behind both FSW and clients led to the most CAI:
26.7~(19.7,~33.8)\,\% more than the base case by 2030 % MAN
--- a 104~(50,~167)\,\% increase. % MAN
Leaving behind either FSW or clients resulted in
22.3~(16.5,~27.9)\,\% or 19.1~(12.9,~25.0)\,\% cumulative additional infections
\vs the base case, respectively. % MAN
Results were similar for additional incidence rate (AIR).
In all counterfactual scenarios, the majority of additional infections were
transmitted via casual partnerships (Figure~\ref{fig:art.1.wiw.part}), % MAN
and acquired among non-FSW women (Figure~\ref{fig:art.1.wiw.to}). % MAN
Patterns of onward transmission were also similar across scenarios % MAN
(Figure~\ref{fig:art.1.wiw.from}),
though subpopulation contributions increased if they were left behind.

\subsection{Objective~2: Conditions that maximize the influence of cascade differences}\label{art.res.2}
The fitted regression models \eqref{eq:art.2.glm} indicated that
population-overall viral non-suppression ($D$) and
relative non-suppression among FSW and clients ($d_i$)
each had strong and positive effects on 2030 CAI and AIR outcomes ($p < 10^{-5}$),
though the effect size was larger for clients.
These effects support the results of Objective~\ref{obj:art.1}.
Figure~\ref{fig:art.2} plots the estimated effects of
subpopulation-specific non-suppression $d_i$, and
effect modification by epidemic conditions $C_j$.
% MAN below
The effect of relative non-suppression among both FSW and clients on CAI and AIR increased with:
larger client population size,
faster client turnover,
larger HIV prevalence ratio among clients \vs other men, and
smaller HIV prevalence ratio among FSW \vs other women.
The effect of relative non-suppression among FSW further increased slightly with
duration in sex work, while
the effect of relative non-suppression among clients further increased slightly with
\emph{smaller} FSW population size.
