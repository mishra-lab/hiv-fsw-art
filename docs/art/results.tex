\section{Results}\label{art.res}
We first summarize modelled patterns of HIV transmission in the base case (1000 model fits),
calibrated to reflect the Eswatini epidemic up to 2020.
% LW: "In the base case (calibrated to reflect the HIV epidemic features and HIV treatment cascade in Eswatini between year xx and xx),"
% JK: Ooh, I like this preface --- I've adapted slightly
% SM: ok to say clients instead of clients of FSW (since we only have one definition of clients);
%     same comments as before re: populations vs groups;
% JK: Sounds good --- sometimes in a new section I spell out acronyms etc. again
%     in case the reader is skipping through sections (as I often do...)
Our model suggests that transmission within regular sex work partnerships
was a dominant driver of early epidemic growth
% Early epidemic emergence in Eswatini was driven by unmet needs in the context of regular sex work partnerships
% SM: lets do a full review re: language that may lead to inadvertent "people/partnerships" to blame,
%     and revise re: unmet needs in the context of... (I know more words but it has been helpful feedback for previous papers!).
%     also, how about either defining driver, or rewording to say that depended on...;
%     I'm also not sure the term "early epidemic emergence" will be clear to non-modelers?
%     emergence in Eswatini is due to unmet needs in context of sex work.
%     (but what if it was also related to what was happening in South Africa).
%     Am thinking we couch this slightly more cautiously... see what you think of these edits?
%     "In the modeled epidemic, transmission in the context of regular sex work partnerships was the most important driver of epidemic growth."
%     (that way we do not get into the issues of emergence, without connections to other countries,
%     being a stickiing point for reviewers and distracting from the main hypotheses/questions in the paper?)
% JK: Re-reading this section, I apologize: there were many instances of stigmatizing language...
%     I've tried to revise thoroughly to avoid.
%     One caveat is that the phrase 'in the context of' I find not as precise and potentially confusing:
%     e.g. reading 'transmission in the context of x partnerships'
%     I think, is this different from 'transmission within x partnerships'?
%     If so, does it maybe include onward transmission resulting from infections acquired within x partnerships?
%     I would prefer 'transmission within x partnerships' --- is this OK alternative?
%     It does not implicate any subpopulation or even the partnership with 'active' role in transmission,
%     only that transmission occurred (action) within the partnership (passive), so hopefully it is not stigmatizing?
% LW: Need to clarify here: do u mean causal contribution the most since 1997 (from 1997 onward) or by 1997;
%     The latter felt after 1997, sth else contributed the most. Although I guess u meant the former.
% JK: I've added 'yearly new' to clarify --- I am mainly drawing on the Figs below for these statements
(Figures \ref{fig:wiw.base.part}~and~\ref{fig:wiw.base.alluvial}).
However, from approximately 1997 onward,
the majority of new yearly infections were transmitted within casual partnerships, % MAN
% SM: cumulative infections by 1997 or annual infections in 1997?
%     suggest terms like 'transmissions in context of xxx partnership'
%     (am thinking about how we do not want to say specific partnerships are to "blame",
%     but that unmet needs within those contexts?) I obviously spend a lot of time thinking about
%     how to frame this as have been on multiple receiving ends of how my phrasing over the years has evolved
%     based on community and Stef and others' feedback on language ...
%     and is still a work in progress for me! so just thinking aloud here too...
% JK: As noted above, 'were transmitted within casual partnerships' OK?
% SB: Do we know these to be non-transactional? I always found the MCP (mutliple concurrent partnership) framing difficult
%     as we folks often were not asked about the dynamics of these partnerships even if not formal sex work.
% JK: Great point --- what about adding the new footnote below.
%     Also maybe worth noting that casual partnerships in our model are not restricted to 'medium activity', FSW, clients;
%     even 'lowest activity' can have casual partnerships.
including 44\% (median) of infections in 2020 in the base case.% % MAN
\footnote{In our model, casual partnerships can be formed by any subpopulation,
  and these partnerships subsume transactional partnerships.}
% SM: instead of calling this base case within sentences, how about this section starts with the basecase..
% JK: Definitely --- LW also suggested this above and I've added :)
% HM: The sentence jumped from 1997 to 2020? Also, sex work regular seems contributed most of infection in early years?
%     Casual does not seem to have 44$ based on B.14
% JK: Hopefully it is more clear now re. which periods are being described in the above sentences?
%     The 44% from 2020 looks OK to me -- it is calculated in the code.
By 2020, the majority of cumulative infections acquired
were among women with lowest sexual activity (Figure~\ref{fig:wiw.base.to}),
while the majority of cumulative infections transmitted
were from clients (Figure~\ref{fig:wiw.base.from}).
% SM: lets avoid "X population transmitted infections" (i know used by modelers all the time,
%     and even Leigh and others, but am trying to put myself in the shoes of clients here... :).
%     also, are we including indirect transmissions and if so, would be worth mentioning?
% SM: from clients directly/indirectly or overall?
%     I think would be good to split up this sentence to ensure reader doesn't misinterpret.
% JK: Is this revised 'majority of infections transmitted were from clients' passive enough?
%     This does not include indirect transmission
Overall HIV prevalence in 2020 was median (95\% CI):
24.4~(23.3,~25.4)\,\% (Figure~\ref{fig:fit.prev}), % MAN
and overall incidence was 8.0~(6.7,~9.4) per 1000 person-years (Figure~\ref{fig:fit.inc}).
The prevalence ratio between FSW and women overall was 1.75~(1.69,~1.86), % MAN
and between clients and men overall it was 2.14~(1.55,~2.99) % MAN
(Figure~\ref{fig:fit.prev1v2}).
% SM: so overall includes non-clients yes?
% JK: men overall includes both non-clients and clients.
% LW: I wonder if this should proceed the contribution part above
% JK: I thought about it too --- but all the early epidemic stuff is about contributions (vs prevalence)
%     so it feels better to start with that, then have prevalence almost as a consequence of those conditions
Due to turnover and higher HIV incidence among FSW,
achieving similar rates of diagnosis among FSW \vs other women (Figure~\ref{fig:fit.dx.rate})
required approximately twice the rate of testing. % MAN
Sex work contributed a growing proportion of infections
over 2020--2040: from 40\% to 52\% (Figure~\ref{fig:wiw.base.part}). % MAN

\subsection{Objective~1: Influence of cascade differences between subpopulations}\label{art.res.1}
% SM: one suggestion to consider (but see what you think), might it help to call the scenairos A, B, C, D.
%     Probably not (too many more things to remember, but would just give it a thought).
%     I found myself sometimes still going back and forth a bit to Table 2 when reading this part of the results.
%     (though I don't know that A, B, C, D would change that! ;)
% JK: Yeah, I do think that the 'leave behind' labels are maybe most clear
Figure~\ref{fig:art.1.cascade} illustrates ART cascade attainment over time
in each of the four counterfactual scenarios (\casmd overall by 2020),
and the base case (\cashi overall by 2020).
Figure~\ref{fig:art.1.inc} illustrates overall HIV incidence in each scenario.
Figure~\ref{fig:art.1.rai} then illustrates
cumulative additional infections (CAI) and additional incidence rate (AIR)
in each counterfactual scenario \vs the base case.
Leaving behind both FSW and clients led to the largest CAI: median (95\%~CI)
% SB: In other places you used quotation marks for each time you wrote "leaving behind".
% JK: I've removed throughout now
26.7~(19.7,~33.8)\,\% more than the base case by 2030. % MAN
By contrast, leaving behind neither FSW and nor clients led to the fewest additional infections:
% SM: this is in the methods, but I think worth repeating here at least once.
% JK: the counterfactual cascade (\casmd = 80-80-90) ?
%     is given in the first sentence in this subsection --- does that work?
13.3~(9.2,~18.7)\,\% more than the base case by 2030 --- % MAN
a 50.9~(33.5,~62.5)\,\% reduction. % MAN
Leaving behind either FSW or clients resulted in
22.3~(16.5,~27.9)\,\% or 19.1~(12.9,~25.0)\,\% additional infections
\vs the base case, respectively. % MAN
Results were similar for additional incidence rate (AIR).
In all counterfactual scenarios, the majority of additional infections were
transmitted via casual partnerships (Figure~\ref{fig:art.1.wiw.part}), % MAN
and acquired among non-FSW women (Figure~\ref{fig:art.1.wiw.to}). % MAN
Patterns of onward transmission were also similar across scenarios % MAN
(Figure~\ref{fig:art.1.wiw.from}),
though subpopulation contributions increased if they were left behind.
% SM: maybe rephrase this sentence, or break it up into two (edited for this option)
% LW: Interesting. would benefit some clarification â€“see if my edits reflects what you mean here.
%     And provide numbers would be helpful.
%     "In the scenario when FSW were left behind, the most additional infections in the population
%     were attributed to infections among clients (xx%); in the scenario when clients ..."
% JK: I may have forgot to review this result with latest calibration update
%     so the text did not reflect the results very well...
%     i.e. while FSW / clients % of total onward transmission increased when they were left behind,
%     they were never the largest % of total onward transmission.
%     I've revised to be more precise now.

\subsection{Objective~2: Conditions that maximize the influence of cascade differences}\label{art.res.2}
The fitted regression models \eqref{eq:art.2.glm} indicated that
population-overall viral non-suppression ($D$) and
% RK: Reading that word hurts me, but perhaps "lack of suppression" is too clunky?
% JK: Aha, you were not alone...! have changed to non-suppression, with some more details in methods
relative non-suppression among FSW and clients ($d_i$)
each had strong and positive effects on 2030 CAI and AIR outcomes ($p < 10^{-5}$),
though the effect size was larger for clients.
% LW: Can you be more specific/ The effect was larger for clients part? Unclear
% JK: Not sure how else I can describe it?
These effects support the results of Objective~\ref{obj:art.1}.
Figure~\ref{fig:art.2} plots the estimated effects of
subpopulation-specific non-suppression $d_i$, and
effect modification by epidemic conditions $C_j$.
% MAN below
The effect of relative non-suppression among both FSW and clients on CAI and AIR increased with:
larger client population size,
faster client turnover,
larger HIV prevalence ratio among clients \vs other men, and
smaller HIV prevalence ratio among FSW \vs other women.
The effect of relative non-suppression among FSW further increased slightly with
duration in sex work, while
the effect of relative non-suppression among clients further increased slightly with
\emph{smaller} FSW population size.
