We sought to answer the following questions (objectives):
\begin{enumerate}
  \item\label{obj:1} How are projections of ART prevention benefits influenced by
    differences in ART cascade between risk groups?
  \item\label{obj:2} Under which epidemic conditions do such differences have largest influence?
\end{enumerate}
