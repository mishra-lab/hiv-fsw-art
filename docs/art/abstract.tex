\paragraph{Background}
Inequalities in the HIV cascade across populations remain an ongoing challenge in the global HIV response. 
Eswatini achieved the UNAIDS 95-95-95 targets by XXXX, with programs for 
female sex workers (FSW) that also ensured FSW living with HIV also reached 95-95-95.
We sought to examine what would have happened if the scale of of 
antiretroviral therapy (ART) to reach 95-95-95 overall also 
``left behind'' populations at highest risk for HIV,
including FSW and their male clients. We examined 
how projections of ART prevention impacts could be influenced by %SM: am worried projections might imply future and not past? how about estimated prevention impacts of ART?
differences in treatment cascade across risk groups, and
under which epidemic conditions such differences have the largest influence.
\paragraph{Methods}
Drawing on population-level and FSW-specific surveys in Eswatini,
we developed a 1008-compartment model of heterosexual HIV transmission
which included eight risk groups and four sexual partnership types.
We calibrated the model to HIV prevalence, incidence, and cascade data,
stratified by risk group where possible.
Taking observed ART scale-up in Eswatini as the base-case  %SM: nice and clear
--- reaching \cashi in the population overall by 2020 ---
we defined four counterfactual scenarios in which
the population overall reached \casmd by 2020,
but where FSW, clients, both, or neither
were disproportionately ``left behind'', reaching only \caslo.
We then quantified relative additional HIV infections by 2030
in counterfactual \vs base-case scenarios.
We further estimated linear effects of
viral suppression gap among FSW and clients on additional infections by 2030, plus
effect modification by FSW/client population sizes, rates of turnover, and HIV prevalence ratios.
\paragraph{Findings}
Compared with the base-case, ``leaving behind'' FSW and their clients
led the most additional infections by 2030: median (95\% credible interval)
26.7 (19.7,~33.8)\% \vs 13.3 (9.2,~18.7)\% if neither were ``left behind''
--- a 50.9 (33.5,~62.5)\% reduction.
Viral suppression gap among clients \vs FSW had a larger effect on additional infections, and
client population size, turnover, and prevalence ratios were the largest modifiers of both effects.  %SM: not clear from reading sentence, what "both effects" refer to?
\paragraph{Interpretation}
Inequalties in the HIV cascade among populations at higher risk for HIV,  %SM: the term "disproprotionate gaps" is a bit unclear here - do we mean gaps between FSW and clients, or between whom? I think we can get through easier to reader by  using term "inequalities" (like some suggestions in the background section re: Inequalities in viral suppression / cascade among populations at higher risk...); also why just viral suppression in conclustion statement but 95-95-95 in intro (i know gets to the same thing, but then perhaps make the viral suppresion part specific up front in background section)?
including FSW and their clients,
can undermine the anticipated prevention impacts of ART scale-up.
Identifying and addressing inequaliites in the HIV cascade, particularly at the intersection of high onward transmission risks, 
could maximize incidence reductions, %SM: but Eswatini achieved so....? 
alongside continued investment in established prevention tools. %SM: why only established prevention tools?
