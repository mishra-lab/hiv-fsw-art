\section{Discussion}\label{art.disc}
We sought to explore how inequalities in the ART cascade
that intersect with HIV risk heterogeneity
may influence the model-estimated prevention impacts of ART.
In our applied analysis of Eswatini, we found that
slower cascade scale-up that left behind female sex workers (FSW) and their clients
could have resulted in 50--167\% more infections by 2030 \vs slower scale-up alone.
We also found that the impact of
leaving behind FSW and/or clients was largely determined by
characteristics of the client population, including:
population size, turnover, and relative HIV prevalence.
\par
Eswatini has recently surpassed 95-95-95 for the population overall \cite{SHIMS3}.
The \emph{MaxART} program \cite{MaxART2} helped achieve these targets through
numerous initiatives coordinated across sectors.
Diverse stakeholders, including people living with HIV, healthcare providers,
traditional and religious leaders, community groups, and researchers
were engaged via multiple channels, including a Community Advisory Board
and specific meetings for prioritized groups (men and adolescents).
Drawing on this engagement and
social science research to understand barriers to care,
cascade services were comprehensively strengthened over 2011--2018 via investments in
training, infrastructure, anti-stigma communication, demand creation, and monitoring.
\par
Among Swati FSW living with HIV, self-reported proportions diagnosed and on ART
were estimated to be 88\% and 86\% (98\% among diagnosed) in 2021 \cite{EswIBBS2022},
though data on viral suppression were lacking.
Although lower than 95-95-95, these achievements are impressive
considering high HIV incidence and turnover among FSW,
which necessitate higher rates of HIV testing, ART initiation, and retention.
Indeed, alongside population-level initiatives,
key populations programs in Eswatini have continued to grow in recent years \cite{EswIBBS2022}.
Such programs offer safe access to tailored services via
community centers, mobile outreach, venue-based, and one-on-one options.
Parallel efforts have also helped reduce structural vulnerabilities,
including experiences of harassment, violence, and fear of seeking healthcare,
through community empowerment, legal supports, and
training for police and healthcare workers \cite{EswIBBS2022}.
\par
As Eswatini has shown,
efforts to maximize ART cascade coverage must not overlook marginalized populations,
for whom barriers to engagement in HIV care often intersect with drivers of HIV risk,
including economic insecurity, mobility, stigma, discrimination, and criminalization
\cite{Wanyenze2016,Schwartz2017,Schmidt-Sane2022,Camlin2019,Baral2019}.
Such populations can be reached effectively through
tailored services to meet their specific needs \cite{EswIBBS2022,Ehrenkranz2019},
services which can be designed and refined with ongoing community leadership and engagement.
As we have shown, an equity-focused approach to ART cascade scale-up
can maximize prevention impacts, and accelerate the end of the HIV epidemic.
\par
Our study highlights the importance of reaching both FSW and their clients,
echoing recent modelling studies of South Africa and Cameroon \cite{Stone2021,Silhol2024}.
These studies found that gaps in HIV prevention and treatment for clients
were among the largest contributors to onward transmission in recent years.
Such findings reiterate the need for improved data on both FSW and clients,
including estimates of population size, sexual behaviour, and ART cascade attainment.
These estimates may be difficult to obtain
because individuals are unlikely to report buying or selling sex in population-level surveys
due to stigma and criminalization \cite{Behanzin2013} and
because many clients are highly mobile
(including transient seasonal/occupational migration) \cite{Camlin2019}.
Thus, innovative study designs, bias adjustments, and services may be needed
to understand and meet clients' needs.
\par
While numerous modelling studies have examined
the potential prevention impacts of ART cascade scale-up
\cite{Knight2022sr} (Appendix~\ref{sr.ric}),
our study is the first to explore the impact of
inequalities in ART cascade across subpopulations
with consistent population overall cascade across scenarios.
Similar work by \citet{Marukutira2020} illustrated the limited impact of
achieving 95-95-95 for only citizens and not immigrants in Botswana,
while \citet{Maheu-Giroux2019cost} illustrated the high cost-effectiveness of
prioritizing key populations (including clients) for ART in C\^{o}te dâ€™Ivoire.
Indeed, our findings are likely generalizable to other epidemic contexts.
HIV prevalence ratios between key populations and the population overall
are relatively low in Eswatini \vs elsewhere;
thus, the impact of cascade inequalities among key populations in other contexts
would likely be even greater than we found for Eswatini.
Moreover, as HIV incidence declines in many settings,
transmissions may become concentrated among key populations \cite{Brown2019},
further magnifying the impact of cascade inequalities.
\par
A primary strength of our analysis is the use of
observed ART cascade scale-up to 95-95-95 in Eswatini as the base case,
with plausible cascade inequalities explored in counterfactual scenarios.
As noted above, the available data suggest that Eswatini has
minimized cascade inequalities which persist elsewhere \cite{Hakim2018}.
Thus, our counterfactual scenarios directly estimate
the consequences of failing to address these inequalities.
Second, drawing on our conceptual framework for risk heterogeneity \cite[Table~1]{Knight2022sr}
and multiple sources of context-specific data
\cite{SDHS2006,SHIMS1,SHIMS2,Baral2014,EswKP2014,EswIBBS2022},
we captured several dimensions of risk heterogeneity, including:
heterosexual anal sex,
four types of sexual partnerships,
sub-stratification of FSW and clients into higher and lower risk strata,
and subpopulation turnover
(Table~\ref{tab:art.het}, Appendix~\ref{mod}).
Accurate modelling of risk heterogeneity
has been shown to mediate model-estimated ART prevention impacts \cite{Hontelez2013},
and is especially important when considering differential ART scale-up across subpopulations.
Finally, our analytic approach to Objective \ref{obj:art.2},
in which epidemic conditions are conceptualized as potential effect modifiers
represents a unique methodological contribution to the HIV modelling literature.
\par
Our study also has limitations.
First, we did not model pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP).
However, our analyses focus on the time period
prior to widespread PrEP availability in Eswatini.
Second, we did not consider transmitted drug resistance (TDR).
However, drug resistance is more likely to emerge
in the context of barriers to viral suppression;
thus, lower cascade among those at higher risk
would likely accelerate emergence of transmitted drug resistance,
and thereby magnify our findings.
Finally, our model structure did not include age,
and we only considered heterosexual HIV transmission in Eswatini.
Future work can explore adaptation of the model to consider
PrEP, TDR, age stratification, and additional modes of HIV transmission.
While the magnitude of our results may change with such adaptations,
we do not expect that the qualitative interpretation would change.
In fact, our findings would likely generalize
to other transmission networks and determinants of risk heterogeneity,
including other key populations and subpopulations such as
highly mobile populations and young women \cite{Camlin2019,Cheuk2020}.
\par
In conclusion, the HIV response must remain rooted in
context-specific understandings of inequalities in HIV risk and in access to HIV services,
which often stem from common upstream factors.
Thus, differences in ART cascade within and between subpopulations at higher risk of HIV
must be monitored, characterized, and addressed
to fully realize the anticipated benefits of ART
at both the individual and population levels.
